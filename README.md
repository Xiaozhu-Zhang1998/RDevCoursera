# R Development

This is a repository of R programming and development materials from several aspects. 

- The folders 1- 4 are from the Coursera Specialization [Mastering Software Development in R](https://coursera.org/specialization/r), the contents of which can be found in the 1st book in the list below.  
- The folders **Practical Machine Learning** and **Statistical Inference** are from the Coursera Specialization [Data Science Specialization](https://coursera.org/specialization/jhu-data-science), and contents in those folders are some solutions and assignments.
- My favorite part here is the **Shiny** app! A lot of demos there ;)
- The **Rmarkdown** is also a cool part, especially extensions such as the beamer, xaringan and dashboards.
